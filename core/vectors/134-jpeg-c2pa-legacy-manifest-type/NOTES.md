# 134-jpeg-c2pa-legacy-manifest-type

Vector 124 with its manifest typed `c2md` (63326D64-…) instead of `c2ma`: the legacy standard-manifest type that C2PA 11.2.2 says manifest consumers accept and claim generators do not write. A reader reads `c2ma`, `c2um` and `c2md` alike: **authentic** at depth 0.

## C2PA

- `expected.json` `c2pa`: what c2pa-rs 0.91.0 (c2pa-node 0.9.8), trust anchor _trust/c2pa-test/root.pem reports. Informative: no vcap verdict reads it.
- c2patool 0.28.0 (trust anchor `_trust/c2pa-test/root.pem`): **Invalid**; success: `assertion.hashedURI.match`, `claimSignature.insideValidity`, `claimSignature.validated`, `signingCredential.trusted`; informational: `signingCredential.ocsp.skipped`; failure: `assertion.dataHash.mismatch`.

Minted by `tools/src/make-c2pa-vectors.ts` with the test key in `tools/src/testkey.ts` and the C2PA test signer in `vectors/_trust/c2pa-test/`. Committed, not regenerated: c2pa-rs salts every assertion at random (`vectors/README.md`).
