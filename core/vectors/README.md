# Conformance vectors

One directory per case, numbered. Each has `expected.json` and `NOTES.md`, plus
its input:

| `kind` | Input | What it exercises |
|---|---|---|
| `file` | `input.<ext>`, optional `input.<ext>.vcap` sidecar, `proof.json` for reading | trailer, canonical bytes, core signature, key binding, version policy, absence labels |
| `container` | `input.mp4`, `proof.json` for reading | everything `file` does **plus** §5: every present segment's `content_hash` recomputed from the NAL units and audio frames of the received container |
| `segments` | `segments.json` — `capture_id`, `pub`, `segment_count`, `segments[]` | the §5 chain at message level: content hashes given, no container |
| `jcs` | `core.json` | canonicalization: expected `core_bytes_hex` and `core_hash` |

`expected.json` for `file` and `segments` vectors carries the fields a verifier
must reproduce: `outcome` (`authentic`, `verified_clip`, `tampered`,
`nested_proof`, `corrupted_proof`, `no_proof_found`, `unsupported_format_version`),
`labels` (the §8 labels, sorted), `not_evaluated` (unknown top-level keys,
sorted), `core_hash` (hex, when a core was read) and `segments.verified` (the
indexes that verified). `debug`, where present, is for humans: intermediate
bytes to compare before touching signatures.

Expected verdicts are decided in review from the spec and written down first;
`tools/src/generate.ts` then produces the inputs and aborts if the reference
verifier in `tools/src/verify.ts` disagrees. **Never edit an `expected.json` to
make an implementation pass.** Either the implementation is wrong or the spec
is; fix that.

The test key in `tools/src/testkey.ts` is public by design: anyone can
regenerate the vectors. Base media in `_media/` (a 16×16 JPEG, its HEIC, a two-frame
H.264 MP4) are the unsealed inputs.

**The `container` vectors are the exception.** They were sealed by real hardware
and carry a real device's key in `sig.pub`, so `npm run generate` cannot make
them — it has no camera and no device key, and it now owns only the directories
it declares, printing the ones it left alone. It used to delete every numbered
directory before rewriting, which for these four was not a rewrite but a loss. `tools/src/derive-container-vectors.ts`
rebuilds all four from the two sealed files a device produced, which is what
keeps the two edited cases (38, 39) auditable rather than asserted. An
implementation that only ever meets this repository's test key never learns
whether it can read a real one.

## Running them

```
cd tools && npm ci && npm test        # every vector against the reference verifier
npm run generate                       # rewrite vectors/NN-* (signatures change: ECDSA is randomized)
```

An implementation passes conformance when, for every directory, it produces
the same `outcome`, `labels`, `not_evaluated`, `core_hash` and `segments.verified`
as `expected.json`, and the same `core_bytes_hex` for `jcs` vectors.

## Not here yet, and why

- **Container-level video on iOS/MOV**: vectors 36–39 cover Android's H.264 and
  HEVC; the MOV branch arrives with S1. The chain alone is still covered at
  message level (25–31), which is the layer a verifier without a demuxer
  implements.
- **Proof level** (§7: attestation chains, registry inclusion, revocation):
  after C6 exposes the material. The signature layer here never evaluates it.
- **`timestamp` and `anchor` attachments**: after C7/C8.
- **Watermark-only match, cropped photo beyond the correction budget**:
  detector vectors, ML review.
