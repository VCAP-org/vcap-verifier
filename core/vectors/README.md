# Conformance vectors

One directory per case, numbered. Each has `expected.json` and `NOTES.md`, plus
its input:

| `kind` | Input | What it exercises |
|---|---|---|
| `file` | `input.<ext>`, optional `input.<ext>.vcap` sidecar, `proof.json` for reading | trailer, canonical bytes, core signature, key binding, version policy, absence labels |
| `container` | `input.mp4` or `input.mov`, `proof.json` for reading | everything `file` does **plus** §5: every present segment's `content_hash` recomputed from the NAL units and audio frames of the received container |
| `segments` | `segments.json` — `capture_id`, `pub`, `segment_count`, `segments[]` | the §5 chain at message level: content hashes given, no container |
| `jcs` | `core.json` | canonicalization: expected `core_bytes_hex` and `core_hash` |

`_timestamps/` holds the committed RFC 3161 tokens the timestamp vectors carry,
minted by `tools/src/make-timestamp-tokens.ts` — committed for the reason the
attestation chains are, and the generator refuses a token whose imprint is not
the core hash it just built.

Two directories are not vectors: `_media/` holds the unsealed inputs, and
`_trust/` holds the anchors a verifier is assumed to hold while checking this
corpus (its README says what the substituted attestation root does and does not
prove). `_chains/` holds the committed attestation chains — see below.

`expected.json` for `file` and `segments` vectors carries the fields a verifier
must reproduce: `outcome` (`authentic`, `verified_clip`, `tampered`,
`nested_proof`, `corrupted_proof`, `no_proof_found`, `unsupported_format_version`),
`labels` (the §8 labels, sorted), `not_evaluated` (unknown top-level keys,
sorted), `core_hash` (hex, when a core was read) and `segments.verified` (the
indexes that verified). `level` (§7: `claimed`, `proven`, `ceiling`) and `validated_at` (the instant
every certificate path was validated at, and what proved it) appear on the
vectors that carry attestation evidence. `location` (§7.1: `claimed`, the
level the core asks for, and `level`, the one the evidence reaches — `none`,
`declared`, `corroborated`, `authenticated`) appears on the position vectors
(74–84) and on 36 and 47, which declare no position and pin `none`. `debug`, where present, is for humans:
intermediate bytes to compare before touching signatures.

`key_status`, where present, is also an **input**: §6.2's online revocation
answer, as the corpus declares a verifier is assumed to have fetched it. It has
to be an input, because the proof cannot carry the *absence* of a later
revocation leaf — nothing in a Merkle tree proves a leaf does not exist — so no
file on its own can reach green. A corpus that pretended otherwise would be
testing a verdict no verifier can reach.

`chain_read`, where present, is an **input** too: what a caller read from the
anchoring contract for that `anchor_id`. Absent means the chain was not
consulted, which is *anchoring not verified* — the offline half of an anchor
proves the path, never that the chain recorded it.

`verifier_clock`, where present, is an **input and not an expectation**: the
verifier's own clock in ms. A §7 verdict depends on it, because certificates
expire — an attested capture read a year later is a different question from the
same capture read the next day (vectors 41 and 43 differ in nothing else). A
vector that left the clock to the calendar would change its own answer over
time, which is the one thing a conformance vector must not do.

Expected verdicts are decided in review from the spec and written down first;
`tools/src/generate.ts` then produces the inputs and aborts if the reference
verifier in `tools/src/verify.ts` disagrees. **Never edit an `expected.json` to
make an implementation pass.** Either the implementation is wrong or the spec
is; fix that.

The test key in `tools/src/testkey.ts` is public by design: anyone can
regenerate the vectors. Next to it, `TEST_OTHER_KEY_PKCS8_BASE64` is a key
that is **nobody's** — not the signing key, not a trusted log — for the vectors
that need somebody else's key (51, a registry leaf about another device). Base media in `_media/` (a 16×16 JPEG, its HEIC, a two-frame
H.264 MP4) are the unsealed inputs.

**Regeneration is byte-stable.** `npm run generate` signs with RFC 6979
(deterministic `k`, derived from the key and the message), so a run that changes
nothing produces no diff — which is what makes a diff worth reading. It was not
always so: ECDSA's random `k` rewrote every signature on every run, and two
vector inputs were built from `randomBytes`, so their `media.hash` and
`core_hash` moved too. Forty changed files hide the one that was meant to
change.

**The attestation chains are committed, not generated.** `vectors/_chains/`
holds them and `tools/src/make-attestation-chains.ts` writes them on demand,
outside `npm run generate`. The reason is the one that exempts the container
vectors below: a certificate carries an ECDSA signature, so minting the chains
again produces different bytes and every attested vector would be rewritten on
every run for nothing. Run the script only to change what a chain *says*, and
expect the vectors that use it to change with it.

**The vectors that came off a device are the exception.** `npm run generate`
cannot make them — it has no camera and no device key — and it now owns only the
directories it declares, printing the ones it left alone. It used to delete
every numbered directory before rewriting, which for these was not a rewrite
but a loss. Two scripts rebuild them instead, each pointed at the artifacts a
device produced: `tools/src/derive-container-vectors.ts` for 36-39 (Android) and
`tools/src/derive-ios-vectors.ts` for 47-48 and 85 (iOS). That is what keeps the
edited cases (38, 39) auditable rather than asserted.

They are not all the same weight of evidence, and each `NOTES.md` says which it
is. 36-39, 47 and 85 carry a **real device signature**: an implementation that
only ever meets this repository's test key never learns whether it can read a
real one, and 47 and 85 are the proofs here made by a Secure Enclave — 85 is
the only one where a Secure Enclave signed a **segment chain** and not just a
core. In 48 the **container** is the device's and every `content_hash` is
recomputed from it, but the chain over them is synthesized with the test key —
the S1 spike inserted vcap SEIs and had not yet sealed a video, so at the time
there was no iOS video signature to carry. 85 is that file, two days later:
same phone, `AVAssetWriter` again, and the chain its own.

## Running them

```
cd tools && npm ci && npm test        # every vector against the reference verifier
npm run generate                       # rewrite the vectors/NN-* it owns; byte-stable, see above
```

## Corpus version and manifest

The numbered corpus (`vectors/NN-*`) has its own version, in `vectors/VERSION`
— separate from `vcap/1.0`, the proof format version. The format version says
what a proof looks like; the corpus version says which exact vectors an
implementation checked itself against, so a third party can claim "conformant
with vcap-spec corpus 1.0.0" and mean something a consumer can check.

`vectors/MANIFEST.json` is that check: for every `vectors/NN-*` directory, its
`kind`, its `outcome`, and a SHA-256 over its files (name and length included,
so a renamed or truncated file changes the hash even if some other file's
bytes happen to collide); plus one hash per shared fixture directory
(`_media`, `_trust`, `_chains`, `_timestamps`, `_watermark`) so a change to an
input every vector depends on is as visible as a change to a vector itself. It
is generated, never hand-edited:

```
npm run manifest         # (re)writes vectors/MANIFEST.json from vectors/ and vectors/VERSION
npm run manifest:check   # exits 1 if the committed file is stale — CI runs this
```

`vectors/CONFORMANCE.md` says what the sentence "conformant with corpus
1.0.0" has to contain to be checkable — corpus version, manifest hash, and
how many vectors actually ran — and why a suite that ran zero vectors must be
red. `vectors/conformance-report.json` is this repository's own claim in that
format, regenerated and checked by CI (`npm run conformance:report` /
`conformance:check`).

**Bump policy**, the same additive-only rule as everywhere else in this
repository: a vector's hash never changes once published (`AGENTS.md`), so
`VERSION` only ever moves forward. Bump the minor version when vectors are
added, the patch version for a manifest-only regeneration triggered by
something outside `vectors/` (there is not expected to be one, since the
manifest is a pure function of the directory and `VERSION`). A major bump
would mean an existing vector's bytes moved — the one thing this corpus does
not do — so seeing one asks the same question a breaking spec change does.

`vectors/edge-cases/` (below) is not in the manifest and not part of the
versioned corpus: it is regenerated on demand by its own tool, not hand-curated
and reviewed vector by vector, and nothing outside this repository reads it.

## The edge-case generator

`tools/src/generate-edge-cases.ts` produces `vectors/edge-cases/` — vectors a
review would not think to hand-pick one at a time, because they are the same
question asked at every point along a boundary: every offset a trailer can be
truncated at, every byte its magic can be flipped in, every field §6.1/§8
require that a writer could drop, the JCS corners RFC 8785 pins to
ECMAScript's own serialization (negative zero, a supplementary-plane
character, key sort by UTF-16 code unit), and the JPEG fill-byte run next to a
stripped JUMBF segment that exercises canonical.ts's marker walk one byte at a
time. Every case is deterministic — most are exhaustive sweeps over an
enumerated domain, so a seed changes nothing about them; the one case that
flips a single payload bit at a random offset takes `--seed` and picks the
same offset for the same seed. Every generated vector runs through the
reference verifier before being written, exactly as `generate.ts` does for the
numbered corpus, and the script aborts instead of writing a vector the
verifier disagrees with:

```
npm run generate:edge-cases              # seed 1
npm run generate:edge-cases -- --seed 7  # a different, still reproducible, draw
```

It does not exercise the watermark's BCH(255,131) correction radius: there is
no watermark decoder anywhere in this repository (`tools/src/verify.ts` ships
none, by design — see its file comment), so there is nothing here to hand a
marred payload to. That boundary belongs to whichever component owns the
decoder.

**The sidecar vectors** (17, 18, 70, 71, 72) carry `input.<ext>.vcap` next to
the input, and a verifier under test is handed both, as `tools/test/vectors.test.ts`
does. They pin §3.1: the trailer wins when it is found and intact (18), a broken
trailer is *corrupted* whatever the sidecar says (72), and a sidecar alone
restores the full verdict over unchanged bytes (17) and nothing over changed
ones (70, 71). **The C2PA co-existence vectors** (02, 03, 04, 68, 69, 73) carry
no C2PA signature — a JUMBF-shaped APP11 or a `uuid` box with the C2PA extended
type is all the vcap layer looks at — and pin §4.1's two orders, one per
container, and the update-manifest case that fits neither
(`spec/c2pa-interop-1.0.md` §3).

An implementation passes conformance when, for every directory, it produces
the same `outcome`, `labels`, `not_evaluated`, `core_hash`, `segments.verified`
and, where present, `level`, `validated_at` and `location` as `expected.json`,
and the same `core_bytes_hex` for `jcs` vectors.

## Not here yet, and why

Every attachment §6.2 defines now has vectors: `attestation`,
`attestation_status`, `registry` with the online key status, `anchor`,
`timestamp`, `integrity` and `location_corroboration` (74–84, the position
level of §7.1: the full declared claim, a corroboration under the test log
key, one under nobody's key, one lifted from another proof, an unknown
method, a `no-match`, a result outside the enumeration, a claim of
`authenticated` with an evidence kind nobody implements, a claim of
`corroborated` with nothing behind it, an unknown claimed level, and a
corroboration of a `location` with no coordinates).

- **A position that reaches `authenticated`**: no evidence kind exists yet
  (§7.1, §11); the vector arrives with the first one.

- **Watermark-only match, cropped photo beyond the correction budget**:
  detector vectors, ML review.
- **A remuxed or trimmed video with its proof in a sidecar**: the trailer is
  gone, the NAL units and vcap SEIs survive, and §5 should read *verified clip*
  over the whole received file. It needs a real remuxer's output and belongs
  with the container vectors that come off a device (36–39, 48, 85), not with
  the generator.
- **A JPEG carrying a C2PA manifest with a real claim signature** next to a
  vcap trailer, validated by a C2PA validator as well as by ours. Both halves
  of `spec/c2pa-interop-1.0.md` §3 are argued from the C2PA text; the C2PA
  half is not executed here because no C2PA signing credential exists (R4).
